# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Overview:
As part of the WDI course, the week 3 project was to create a game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The brief of the project was to:
- Render a game in the browser
- Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

### To play:
- Access game through URL: https://ttcao.github.io/tic-tac-toe-game/tic-tac-toe.html
- Start playing!

### Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, console, Atom (editor), iTerm, Git.

### Approach taken:
I first built the tic-tac-toe game engine in the backend, which could be played using a JavaScript console. Next I created a user interface in the front using HTML and CSS. JavaScript was then used to integrate the user interface and the game engine.

### Possible improvements:
- For every new game, alternate the first player between "PacMan" and "Blinky".
- Refactor the win/lose game logic to make the game scalable to bigger boards.
